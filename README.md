# Overview     
## Domain: Traffic Control

## Objective
To develop a system that detects traffic congestion at junctions, enabling efficient traffic management and timely intervention.

## Stakeholders

1. **Traffic controller**
2. **Urban Planners**
3. **Law Enforcement**
4. **Tech Providers and Developers**

## User Stories

1. **US1:** as a traffic controller, I want to monitor real-time data on traffic volume
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I can see the number of vehicles passing through the junction over specific periods
   - **acceptance criteria #2** I can see the number of pedestrians crossing the junction over specific periods
   - **acceptance criteria #3** I can identify the peak hours and patterns of traffic congestion
2. **US2:** as a traffic controller, I want to be notified when there is a traffic jam at the junction
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I get no notification if there is no a traffic jam at the junction
3. **US3:** as an urban planner, I need comprehensive traffic data so that I can analyze traffic patterns and plan better road networks
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I can get the raw data that contains the number of vehicles passing through the junction over specific periods
   - **acceptance criteria #2** I can get the raw data that contains the number of pedestrians passing through the junction over specific periods
   - **acceptance criteria #3** I can get the raw data that present the peak hours and patterns of traffic congestion
4. **US4:** as a law enforcement, I want to be notified when there is a traffic jam at the junction, as they might indicate accidents or illegal activities
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I get no notification if there is no a traffic jam at the junction
5. **US5:** as a tech provider/developer, I want to monitor the status of devices
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I can see the status of all devices (online/activated/offline).
   - **acceptance criteria #2** I can see a map of installed devices.
