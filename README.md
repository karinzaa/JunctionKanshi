# Overview     
## Domain: Traffic Control

## Objective
To develop a system that detects traffic congestion at junctions, enabling efficient traffic management and timely intervention.

## Core Components
1. **Sensors and Cameras:** Deployed at junctions to monitor traffic flow and density.
2. **Data Processing Unit:** Analyzes data from sensors and cameras, detecting congestion patterns.
3. **Communication System:** Relays information to relevant stakeholders and traffic management systems.
4. **User Interface:** Displays real-time traffic data for public use and traffic management teams.

## Technology Stack
- **IoT Devices:** For real-time data collection.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** To analyze traffic patterns and predict jams.
- **Cloud Computing:** For data storage and processing.

## Stakeholders

1. **Local Government and Transportation Authorities:** Responsible for traffic management and infrastructure planning.
2. **Law Enforcement:** Utilizes the system for managing traffic rules and responding to incidents.
3. **Commuters and General Public:** Beneficiaries of smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.
4. **Urban Planners:** Use data for long-term traffic management and infrastructure development.
5. **Tech Providers and Developers:** Responsible for building and maintaining the system.
6. **Emergency Services:** Utilize real-time traffic data for quicker response times.

## User Stories

1. **As a traffic controller,** I want to receive real-time alerts about traffic jams at junctions, so that I can quickly implement countermeasures like traffic signal adjustments or dispatching traffic officers.
   
2. **As a commuter,** I want to view current traffic conditions at key junctions, so that I can plan my route effectively and avoid congested areas.

3. **As a city planner,** I need comprehensive traffic data from various junctions, so that I can analyze traffic patterns and plan better road networks.

4. **As a law enforcement officer,** I need to be alerted to traffic jams, as they might indicate accidents or illegal activities, allowing for prompt response.

5. **As an emergency responder,** I want to know the real-time traffic situation at junctions, so I can choose the fastest route to the emergency location.

6. **As a system developer,** I need feedback on traffic prediction accuracy, so I can continually improve the algorithm and system performance.
