# Overview     
## Domain: Traffic Control

## Objective
To develop a system that detects traffic congestion at junctions, enabling efficient traffic management and timely intervention.

## Stakeholders

1. **Traffic controller**
2. **Tech Providers and Developers**

## User Stories

1. **US1:** as a traffic controller, I want to monitor real-time data on traffic volume, so I know whether there is a traffic jam or not
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I can see the number of vehicles passing through the junction over specific periods
   - **acceptance criteria #2** I can identify the peak hours and patterns of traffic congestion
2. **US2:** as a traffic controller, I want to be notified when there is a traffic jam at the junction, so I can check and control the traffic
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I get no notification if there is no a traffic jam at the junction
3. **US3:** as a tech provider/developer, I want to monitor the status of devices
   - **acceptance criteria #1** I can see the status of all devices (online/activated/offline).
   - **acceptance criteria #2** I can see a map of installed devices.
