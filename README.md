## Stakeholders
1. **Traffic controller**
2. **Tech Providers and Developers**

## User Stories
1. **US1: as a As a policeman,** I want to monitor real-time data on traffic volume, so I know whether there is a traffic jam or not.
   - **Acceptance criteria 1** I can see the number of vehicles passing through the junction over specific periods.
   - **Acceptance criteria 2** I can identify the peak hours and patterns of traffic congestion.
   - **Acceptance criteria 3** I get no notification if there is no a traffic jam at the junction.
   - **Acceptance criteria 4** I want to be notified when there is a traffic jam at the junction, so I can check and control the traffic.
2. **US2: As a tech provider,** I want to monitor the status of devices.
   - **Acceptance criteria 1** I can see a map of installed devices.
   - **Acceptance criteria 2** I can see the number of vehicles passing through the junction over specific periods.
   - **Acceptance criteria 3** I can identify the peak hours and patterns of traffic congestion.
3. **US3: As a general public,** I want to be notified when there is a traffic jam at the junction, so I can check,
   - **Acceptance criteria 1** I also want to monitor real-time data on traffic volume, so I know whether there is a traffic jam or not as well.
